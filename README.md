&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jump Quest Reborn is a first attempt at a pure python implementation of a 2D side-scroller Jump Quest â€“ a popular subgame found in many classic side-scroller 2D MMORPGs such as MapleStory. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a jump quest, the goal is to navigate a 2D character to the top of the map, where a finishing line awaits. Besides trying to solve for a viable path upwards, the player also needs to navigate dangerous traps.
